# Project 2 - Video Game Inventory

## Overview

Over the years, I have collected and played video games from a variety of consoles, whether they are the newest titles or for free.  As a result, I have a fairly large collection which has become a bit of a challenge to maintain.  This app categorizes those games and consoles including details about the games, my experience playing them, and other features to enhance the gameplaying experience.

* As the owner, I want to be able to edit the details of the game so that I can provide the most up to date information.

* As the owner, I want to be able to click a box in the game details to show that the game was recently played.
